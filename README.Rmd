# sparsevector

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

`sparsevector` provides an efficient S4 implementation of sparse numeric vectors in R.  
It stores only non-zero values and their positions, making it memory-efficient for high-dimensional vectors.

## Installation

You can install the development version of sparsevector like so:

install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("YOURNAME/sparsevector")
Replace `YOURNAME` with your GitHub username.

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(sparsevector)

x <- c(0, 3, 0, 0, 5, 0)
sx <- as(x, "sparse_numeric")
sx
y <- c(1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0)
sy <- as(y, "sparse_numeric")

sx + sy
sx * sy
```
